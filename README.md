# Puzzle Duel

## Overview

This is a two player puzzle game where players compete to see 
who can get the most points in a certain amount of turns. The players play on
a six by six board and earn points by matching three or more orbs. Each orb matched grants 1 point. 
The player with the most points at the end of the turns wins.

## Gameplay

The main menu includes two buttons: one to create a new game lobby, and one to join an existing game lobby. When creating a lobby, the player can adjust the amount of turns in the game as well as the time each player has for one turn. After both players have joined the lobby, the host can start the game.

During the game, players will alternate turns to try and obtain as many points as possible through matching orbs of the same color. Each matched orb will grant the player one point. To match orbs, a player will select a single orb and drag it around the six by six board. The orb that the player's cursor moves over will swap with the one that the player is holding. When either the time runs out or the player releases the orb, the player's turn ends and a new board is generated for the next player to take their turn. At the end of all of the turns, the player wiht the most points wins.
