# Puzzle Duel

## Summary

This is a two player puzzle game where players compete to see 
who can get the most points in a certain amount of turns. The players play on
a 6 x 6 board. Players earn points by erasing orbs. Orbs are erased when 3 or 
more of the same color are touching. Each orb erased grants 1 point. 
Players play a turn by selecting an orb and dragging it; when the orb 
passes over another orb, they swap places. When the player releases the orb or the time runs out, 
their turn is over. At the end of all the turns, the player with the most points is the winner.
