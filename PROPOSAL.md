# Project Proposal - Object Identifier

## Summary

My project involves identifying objects in images. I will have a GUI that allows
the user to submit an image. My program will be able to identify chosen objects 
within that image and will display some basic information about those objects.

### User Experience

Upon running the program, a window will open with a button. Pressing the button 
will allow the user to select an image file from their computer. The user will 
then have the option to either classify the entire image (if the image contains 
a single object), or drag and select a region in the image that contains a single
object to classify. After the object is classified, the name of the object will 
be displayed as well as basic info such as its color, dictionary definition, etc.
The user will have the option to upload another image by pressing the button 
again.
